# Franco's Folio üìÅ

This website will represent my journey in web development as it will be updated with future projects and showcase new skills as I learn and incorporate them into my portfolio. My inspiration for this website was to help me refresh my HTML and CSS skills while also becoming more familiar with frameworks and scripting languages like Bootstrap and Sass. It's my first time using both Bootstrap and Sass, and it has been quite a learning experience. I still have much to learn, especially in creating a more efficient file structure and eliminating redundancies. I also want to expand my knowledge of animations. /
Hope y'all enjoy the journey as much as I do :) <br>

I plan to keep updating this website as I complete more projects and grow my skills.
